## Notes
I made this project for the Shopify Internship Tech Challenge,  I set out to make this project simple and easy to understand.

I wanted to display how comfortable I am with Frontend technology. 

I utilized React and their new React Hooks to simplify the process of implementing data down, actions up. 

For the project setup, I isolated all to be stateless components and had the App.js be the 'store' of the application.

Along with that, I added React Testing Library and Jest to support the behaviour and functionality of the project. 


Some features I plan on implementing in the future includes:

- Saving the nomination list when the user leaves the page

- Sharable Links for the nomination List 

- Refactoring to use  UI library - MUI 

- This project was made using the OMDB API - http://www.omdbapi.com/
